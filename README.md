# Stronghold team 5431 (code)
######Short: The compiled version of all the repos from 2016 stronghold

##Intro:
  This is an entire list of everything from FRC team 5431 in one repo. As you may see that each folder has an internal folder called gitdir, to make it easier and not have to deal with submodules on git all you have to do to get the "actual" repo from that submodule is to rename gitdir to .git and you're done. To check the history per each do git log... The rest you can figure out on your own.
  
##Lists: (name -> description)
  * **finalComp2016:** The final (Competition bot) code used during the competition written in Java
  * **finalPrac2016:** The final (Practice bot) code used during practice because the competition bot wasn't built the same written in Java
  * **kinectRobot:** A kinect to opencv 3.10 interface with Cpp U finder implemented (prototype) written in C++
  * **secondCompProto:** An uncompleted version two of the competition bot that was supposed to fix the differences between the prototype and the final competition version
  * **2016-pyBot:** Off season test of the competition bot in python (frc) and python (opencv)
  * **2016---5431---thirdCompCode:** A non completed version 3 of competition code (Unused)
  * **5431-FRC-2016:** First attempt to use command base robot interface before we knew they were terrible
  * **5431_secondComp:** Version two of manual competition bot without multithreading (Just state machine) logic
  * **Boulder_Shooter_Math:** First couple of days test, to see what angles, heights, distances to automate shooting
  * **FRC-2016-COMP-CODE:** A more complicated 2nd version of comp code with thread managers and pool executors (Not used because of unknown memory leak and time)
  * **FRC-2016-RED-TEAM:** During the beginning the team split into two and this was a mostly working test code for a prototype
  * **FRC-StatsCompiler:** (More detail needed)... Essentially the IOS app data converter to be analyzed
  * **FrcScoutingApp-IOS:** (More detail needed)... App core for scouting and analyzing
  * **GRIP:** A bad shot on trying to add shape detection to GRIP (Not finished but planned)
  * **GRIP_VALUES:** Backup grip values for the team to mess around with around the robot (XML based)
  * **JavaKinectRobot:** More of a init repository to try to get the kinect working with java (thrown out the window, for forgotten reasons)
  * **OpenCV_3.1.0_JAVA:** A U finder for the tower that was written by a beginner OpenCV programmer(Do not use)
  * **OpenCV_Cpp:** A U finder in C++, same desc as above
  * **ThingWorxDataAPI:** A thingworx demo that was presented in boston, an API interface written in Java
  * **UdooThingworx_redirect:** An onboard computer that would redirect data to the controller computer via thingworx and udp written in python
